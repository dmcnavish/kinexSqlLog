# kinexSqlLog
Turns unreadable log statements into a thing of beauty


## Overview
This script is used to make it easier to read a log statement outputted by knex.js. It also inserts the parameters into the query so it can easily be executed in your favorite sql tool of choice. 

Still a work in progress

### Example
```
